# Interactive-Tennis-Visualization---Zoomable-Circles

# Goals:
• To present the results of 10 years of Australian open tournaments in a concise manner
• To show the matchups of various players and their results (won vs defeated)
• To display average tournament stats of all players using:
o First Serve percentage (successful first serve)
o First Point Win percentage (points won on first serve)
o Net percentage (win percentage at net)
o Break percentage (break point conversion)
o Return percentage (return points won)
Visualization justification:
• Zoomable circles from D3 libraries (Left pane of the screen):
o Simultaneously presents all data to the user and allows user to focus on any player/year
o Names of selected player’s defeated opponents are displayed on their respective circle
o As the circles are zoomable, it enables us to add greater number of hierarchies without clustering the user’s screen
o Selected player’s name is displayed on the right pane to avoid clustering
o Allows ease of selection
