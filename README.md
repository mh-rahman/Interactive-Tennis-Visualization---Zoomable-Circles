# Interactive-Tennis-Visualization---Zoomable-Circles

# Goals:
* To present the results of 10 years of Australian open tournaments in a concise manner
* To show the matchups of various players and their results (won vs defeated)
* To display average tournament stats of all players using:
* First Serve percentage (successful first serve)
* First Point Win percentage (points won on first serve)
* Net percentage (win percentage at net)
* Break percentage (break point conversion)
* Return percentage (return points won)

# Visualization justification:
* Zoomable circles from D3 libraries (Left pane of the screen):
* Simultaneously presents all data to the user and allows user to focus on any player/year
* Names of selected player’s defeated opponents are displayed on their respective circle
* As the circles are zoomable, it enables us to add greater number of hierarchies without clustering the user’s screen
* Selected player’s name is displayed on the right pane to avoid clustering
* Allows ease of selection
